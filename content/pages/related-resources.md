{{% resource_link "3c8a6a21-d999-4c2f-a92f-a365e1e761bc" "A New Reality in Video Games: Advertisements" %}} - Game publishers seek new sources of revenue to offset the growing cost of producing games, which can reach $10 million to $20 million, excluding marketing expenses. At the same time, advertisers are looking for new ways to reach 18- to 34-year-old males, a sought-after audience that is increasingly abandoning television (and TV commercials) and spending more time playing video games. The confluence of these trends is likely to make product placement in games more appealing. "This is the next big way publishers are talking about growing their revenue," said Evan Wilson, an industry analyst with Pacific Crest Securities. Mr. Wilson added that the use of commercials was "almost inevitable in mass-market games."

The Matrix Online - "The Matrix Online, from Warner Brothers Interactive Entertainment, is one of the boldest efforts yet to appeal to hardcore players like Ms. Carkner as well as to a wider audience. Massively multiplayer games, which are considered mainstream entertainment in Taiwan and South Korea, still represent a small fraction of the United States video game business. Unlike traditional video games, which have their roots in arcades, these games have more in common with role-playing pastimes like Dungeon & Dragons. "We certainly could be the kind of game that expands the market," said Jason Hall, senior vice president for Warner Brothers Interactive Entertainment, which co-publishes The Matrix with the Sega Corporation."
